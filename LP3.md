# Know Your LP3

## Turn It On/Off

The LP3 can be turned off without unplugging the power cord by holding the "Play" button on its top for 3s.
To turn it back on, tap the same button once. If this did not work for you, make sure your LP2's firmware is up-to-date.

Otherwise, the laser is only well focused in the centre area, and becomes out of focus as it moves away.
