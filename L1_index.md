# L1 & L1 Pro

## The Look
L1 and Pro are of the same size & design, with minor difference as shown below. Therefore both will fit onto the automatic stand.

## Key Specifications

|  | L1 | L1 Pro |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Laser | 450nm Blue, 1600mW | 405nm Blue-Violet, 500mW (equivalent to 1500mW) |
| Pixel Size | 0.3mm (or smaller\*) | 0.15mm |
| Engrave Range|100mm x 100mm | 100mm x 100mm |

\* Can be improved with an easy modification, but engraving range will reduce as a trade-off. Read on.


## Speed Comparison

Due to Pro's increased precision, it takes up to **four** times long to engrave the same amount of pixels. I have tested every depth setting available in the App, and have produced the graph below. It shows how much time a Pro takes compared to an L1.

Some quick numbers to note:

* at up to 75% depth, Pro performs very similarly to L1.
* at 80-85% depth, Pro takes about 1.5 times long compared to L1.
* at 90% depth, Pro takes about 2 times long compared to L1.
* at 95% depth, Pro takes about 2.5 times long compared to L1.
* at 100% depth, Pro takes about 4 times long compared to L1.
